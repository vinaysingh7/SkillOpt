"""SkillOpt-Sleep — central prompt registry with live user overrides.

Every LLM-facing prompt template the sleep cycle uses (miner / attempt /
judge / reflect) lives here, in one place, instead of being scattered as
inline literals. Two consequences:

  1. **Auditability** — the dashboard (and any human) can display exactly
     what instructions each agent role receives, per stage.
  2. **Live tuning** — a user override file (``prompts.json`` in the state
     dir, or ``SKILLOPT_SLEEP_PROMPTS_PATH``) replaces any template without
     touching code. The file's mtime is checked on every read, so an edit
     made while a cycle is running takes effect on the very next call.

Placeholders use the ``__NAME__`` convention (simple ``str.replace``, no
``str.format``) because the templates themselves contain JSON braces.

The default texts are byte-for-byte the prompts previously inlined in
``backend.py`` / ``llm_miner.py``, so behavior is unchanged unless the user
overrides a template.

_MINER = """You are mining a user's past AI-assistant sessions to find RECURRING tasks
worth optimizing a skill for. From the session below, extract 0-3 reusable tasks.

A good task is something the user asks for repeatedly or had to correct, where a
GENERAL rule would help next time (correctness, completeness, tool-use,
conventions). Skip one-off or purely exploratory requests.

For each task return:
  - "intent": the reusable request, generalized (no one-off specifics)
  - "context": the concrete material an answer NEEDS in order to be attemptable —
     the query text, the list, the file contents, the error message, the diff.
     Copy it verbatim from the session. This is NOT optional whenever your
     rubric or checks refer to supplied material: a task saying "review the
     provided query" with no query here is unanswerable, scores every answer at
     zero, and silently poisons the run. If the material is not present in the
     session excerpt below, either omit the task entirely or write an intent
     that does not depend on material you cannot supply. Use "" only for tasks
     that are genuinely self-contained.
  - "checks": a list of programmatic success checks a grader can run on a future
     answer. Give every check a plain-language "description" of the intended
     behavior; it must not repeat regex or grader syntax. Prefer checks about
     WHAT THE ANSWER DOES over how it is formatted:
        {"op":"contains","arg":"<required substring>","description":"<semantic requirement>"}
        {"op":"not_contains","arg":"<prohibited substring>","description":"<semantic requirement>"}
        {"op":"no_refusal","description":"Complete the requested task instead of refusing"}
        {"op":"regex","arg":"<python regex>","description":"<meaning of the pattern, without its syntax>"}
        {"op":"tool_called","arg":"<required tool>","description":"<why the tool must be used>"}
     Formatting checks are available but weak, because an assistant can satisfy
     them by reformatting without answering any better. Use them only alongside
     an outcome check, never alone:
        {"op":"section_present","arg":"<strict heading text>"}
        {"op":"section_contains","arg":"<literal text anywhere in an ATX heading>"}
        {"op":"max_chars","arg":<int>}
        {"op":"min_chars","arg":<int>}
     Only include checks you are confident a GOOD answer must satisfy.
     DERIVE THESE FROM THE ASSISTANT ANSWERS SHOWN BELOW. Concrete identifiers
     that appear in an answer the user accepted — service names, required
     headings, tools that had to be invoked, identifier formats — are exactly
     what a `contains` / `regex` / `tool_called` check should assert. Where the
     answers give you such evidence, returning an empty checks list is a wasted
     opportunity: a check is deterministic and cannot be satisfied by writing
     more words, whereas a rubric can.
  - "rubric": a one-sentence description of what a GOOD answer achieves —
     judged on substance, not on wording or layout. ALWAYS provide this; it is
     the fallback grader when checks cannot capture the substance. Do not let it
     become the ONLY grader when the answers below support concrete checks.
     Never write a rubric that grades material not present in the task itself
     (e.g. "reviews the provided query" when no query is included) — such a
     rubric is unsatisfiable and scores every answer at zero.
  - "satisfied": true/false — did the user seem satisfied with the assistant's answer?

Return ONLY a JSON array (possibly empty). No prose.
