"""SkillOpt-Sleep — consolidate several skill groups in one night.

A night normally consolidates one managed skill. When mined tasks have been
grouped per skill, each group is an independent consolidation: its own tasks, its
own document, its own gate decision. This module drives those runs so that a
group with no tasks, an unusable name, or a failing backend is isolated and
reported instead of aborting the groups around it.

Adoption is unchanged and still explicit: nothing here writes a skill file.
