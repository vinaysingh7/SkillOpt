"""SkillOpt-Sleep — rule-based judges (gbrain-evals compatible).

Implements the programmatic check operators used by gbrain-evals'
skillopt-v1 benchmark so we can score skill outputs locally, with NO judge
API call:

  * section_present <name>   — legacy strict heading/bold/label check
  * section_contains <name>  — an ATX markdown heading contains literal <name>
  * regex <pattern>          — the pattern matches the response
  * max_chars <n>            — response length <= n
  * min_chars <n>            — response length >= n
  * contains <text>          — substring present (case-insensitive)
  * not_contains <text>      — substring absent (case-insensitive)
  * no_refusal               — the response is not a bare refusal/abstention
  * tool_called <name>       — a tool with <name> was invoked (needs a tool loop;
                               in single-shot replay we approximate via an
                               explicit "TOOL_CALL: <name>" marker the agent emits)

Ops divide into two families, and the distinction is load-bearing:

  * *shape* ops (section_present, section_contains, max_chars, min_chars)
    constrain how an answer is formatted. They are trivially satisfiable by an
    optimizer — adding a heading scores 1.0 without the answer improving at all.
  * *outcome* ops (contains, not_contains, no_refusal, regex, tool_called)
    constrain what the answer actually does.

A judge built only from shape ops is a formatting checker, not a grader; see
:func:`is_shape_only`. Callers should prefer an outcome-based judge (rubric or
outcome ops) so the gate cannot be won by reformatting.

A task whose judge is {"kind": "rule", "checks": [...]} passes (hard=1.0) iff
ALL checks pass; soft = fraction of checks passed. This mirrors gbrain's
all-checks-must-pass rule scoring and gives the gate a smooth signal.
