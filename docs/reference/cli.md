## Training

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config <config.yaml> [overrides...]
# Installed equivalent:
skillopt-train --config <config.yaml> [overrides...]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `--config` | Path to YAML config file (required) |
| `--cfg-options key=value [...]` | Override structured config parameters |

### Examples

```bash
# Basic training
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/searchqa/default.yaml \
  --out_root outputs/searchqa_run

# With overrides
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/searchqa/default.yaml \
  --cfg-options optimizer.learning_rate=16 optimizer.lr_scheduler=linear

# With custom initial skill
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/searchqa/default.yaml \
  --cfg-options env.skill_init=skills/my_seed.md
```

## Evaluation

```bash
python scripts/eval_only.py --config <config.yaml> --skill <skill.md>
# Installed equivalent:
skillopt-eval --config <config.yaml> --skill <skill.md>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `--config` | Path to YAML config file (required) |
| `--skill` | Path to skill document to evaluate (required) |
| `--split` | `train`, `valid_seen`, `valid_unseen`, or `all` (default) |
| `--cfg-options` | One or more `section.key=value` overrides |

### Examples

```bash
# Evaluate best skill on test set
python scripts/eval_only.py \
  --config configs/searchqa/default.yaml \
  --skill outputs/searchqa_run/best_skill.md \
  --split valid_unseen

# Evaluate on validation set
python scripts/eval_only.py \
  --config configs/searchqa/default.yaml \
  --skill outputs/searchqa_run/best_skill.md \
  --split valid_seen
```

`--skill` consumes the artifact produced by training. Unless `--out_root` is
set for evaluation, `eval_only.py` creates a separate timestamped
`outputs/eval_<env>_<model>_<timestamp>/` directory and writes
`eval_summary.json` there; it does not modify the training run directory.

For the generic OpenAI-compatible research backend, select the role backends
explicitly:

```bash
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/searchqa/default.yaml \
  --cfg-options \
    model.optimizer_backend=openai_compatible \
    model.target_backend=openai_compatible \
    model.optimizer=deepseek-chat \
    model.target=deepseek-chat
```

To benchmark an installed, authenticated Cursor Agent through an environment
that supports exec targets:

```bash
python scripts/eval_only.py \
  --config configs/searchqa/default.yaml \
  --skill skills/my_skill.md \
  --cfg-options \
    model.optimizer_backend=openai_chat \
    model.target_backend=cursor_exec \
    model.target=composer-2.5
```

`cursor_exec` runs the target only; the optimizer remains separately
configured. Read-only rollouts use Cursor Ask mode. Rollouts that request file
edits use `--force` inside the benchmark workspace, with Cursor sandboxing
enabled. The harness refuses file-edit rollouts when the Cursor sandbox is
disabled. Read-only Ask-mode rollouts may explicitly disable it. Override the
executable or sandbox through `model.cursor_exec_path` and
`model.cursor_exec_sandbox`.

To train or evaluate with the Claude Code CLI execution harness (`claude_code_exec`):

```bash
# Target-only rollout through Claude Code (optimizer defaults to configured chat backend):
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/searchqa/default.yaml \
  --backend claude_code_exec

# Explicitly drive both target and optimizer roles with Claude Code:
python scripts/train.py \
  --config configs/searchqa/default.yaml \
  --cfg-options \
    model.optimizer_backend=claude_code_exec \
    model.target_backend=claude_code_exec
```

When `claude_code_exec` is selected as the target backend, SkillOpt streams SDK
messages from the Claude Code process and parses text, tool calls, and tool
results into structured trace steps (`claude_trace_steps.txt`). When
`model.claude_trace_to_optimizer` is enabled (`true` by default), these trace
steps are injected into the reflection prompt so the optimizer can inspect the
agent's intermediate actions.


## SkillOpt-Sleep

```bash
skillopt-sleep <action> [options]
# Equivalent from a source checkout:
python -m skillopt_sleep <action> [options]
```

Actions are `run`, `dry-run`, `status`, `adopt`, `harvest`, `schedule`,
`unschedule`, and `evalkit`. `evalkit` is also available as
`python -m skillopt_sleep.evalkit` and compares two conditions on one fixed
task manifest (McNemar + bootstrap CI). Exactly one of its `--b` comparison
input or `--aa` identity-check flag is required. See `docs/sleep/evalkit.md`.
Common options for the nightly actions include:

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `--project PATH` | Project used for transcript scope, targets, state, and staging (default: current directory) |
| `--scope invoked\|all` | Harvest this project or all projects |
| `--source claude\|codex\|copilot\|cursor\|pi\|opencode\|auto` | Transcript source; `auto` keeps Codex-then-Claude precedence and does not select Copilot, Cursor, Pi, or OpenCode |
| `--backend mock\|claude\|codex\|copilot\|cursor\|pi\|opencode\|handoff\|azure_openai` | Replay/optimizer backend |
| `--model NAME` | Backend-specific model override |
| `--cursor-home PATH` | Override `~/.cursor` for Cursor transcript harvesting |
| `--pi-home PATH` | Parent directory containing Pi's `agent/sessions` tree (default: `~/.pi`) |
| `--vscode-workspace-storage PATH` | Override VS Code's `User/workspaceStorage` root for Copilot transcript harvesting |
| `--cursor-path PATH` | Path to the installed Cursor Agent CLI |
| `--pi-path PATH` | Path to the installed Pi coding-agent CLI |
| `--opencode-path PATH` | Path to the installed OpenCode CLI |
| `--opencode-db PATH` | Path to the OpenCode SQLite history database |
| `--opencode-tool-replay` | Enable OpenCode tool-aware replay for `tool_called` checks in rule judges |
| `--copilot-replay-profile PATH` | `run`/`dry-run` only: opt into a local directory containing `mcp-config.json` |
| `--copilot-replay-tool NAME` | `run`/`dry-run` only: exact Copilot tool name to expose and auto-approve during replay; repeatable, required with a profile |
| `--preferences TEXT` | House rules supplied to reflection |
| `--lookback-hours N` | Initial transcript lookback; `0` scans all history |
| `--max-sessions N` / `--max-tasks N` | Bound the harvested workload |
| `--target-skill-path PATH` | Explicit skill document to stage/adopt |
| `--skill-root PATH` | Add a skill-resolution root; repeatable, with relative paths resolved below `--project` |
| `--tasks-file PATH` | Replay a reviewed task JSON file instead of harvesting |
| `--edit-budget N` | Maximum bounded edits for the night |
| `--progress` / `--json` | Progress or machine-readable output |
| `--auto-adopt` | Apply an accepted staged proposal automatically |

`adopt` also accepts `--skill NAME` (repeatable) and `--all-skills` for a night
that staged per-skill proposals. Use `--legacy` to adopt only a co-staged
managed `SKILL.md` / `CLAUDE.md` proposal. Bare `adopt` on a fan-out night lists
the names and exits instead of promoting anything. A leading-dash name must use
the unambiguous `--skill=--name` form. See
[multi-skill staging](../sleep/multi-skill-staging.md).

Fan-out resolves existing project-native `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`,
`.cursor/skills`, and `.devin/skills` directories plus the established Claude
roots. Use `--skill-root` for another integration-specific location. Configure
the canonical `multi_skill_fanout` key to enable proposal fan-out;
`multi_skill_report` remains a compatibility alias.

The `mock` and `handoff` backends make no network calls. A real backend sends
mining, replay, judging, and reflection prompts derived from harvested
transcripts and tasks to its selected provider. Review that provider's
data-retention and privacy policy before processing sensitive sessions.

### VS Code GitHub Copilot Chat source

`--source copilot` reads local VS Code GitHub Copilot Chat session logs from
the platform's stable and Insiders `User/workspaceStorage` locations, plus the
portable location when `VSCODE_PORTABLE` is available. Use
`--vscode-workspace-storage PATH` for a nonstandard root. Each workspace must
have a readable adjacent `workspace.json` mapping to a local project; unmapped
windows are skipped so project scoping cannot silently mix unrelated sessions.
`--source auto` does not select Copilot.

The harvester retains user-entered prompts, visible assistant Markdown, and
tool names from requests confirmed as GitHub Copilot Chat. It excludes
system-initiated notifications, reasoning, tool inputs and outputs, rendered
context, and account/model metadata. Known secret-shaped strings are redacted
as defense in depth, but review harvested tasks before sending them to a model
provider. Transcript harvesting is independent of `--backend copilot`, which
invokes the GitHub Copilot CLI for model calls.

The managed `schedule` command does not persist `--source` or
`--vscode-workspace-storage`. Before scheduling this source, set
`"transcript_source": "copilot"` and, when needed,
`"vscode_workspace_storage": "/absolute/path/to/workspaceStorage"` in
`~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json`.

### Copilot replay MCP profile

Registering SkillOpt as an MCP server does **not** forward the caller's MCP
definitions into replay. Copilot calls normally use a clean temporary working
directory and an isolated `COPILOT_HOME`, with built-in MCP servers and custom
instructions disabled.

For tasks that need real MCP tools, explicitly select a **local, dedicated
profile directory** and an **exact tool allowlist**. For example, keep a
`replay-profile` directory outside version control with this illustrative
`mcp-config.json` (replace the example command with your installed server):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "catalog": {
      "command": "example-catalog-mcp",
      "args": ["--read-only"],
      "tools": ["get_item", "list_items"]
    }
  }
}
```

Use commands on `PATH` or absolute command/argument paths: MCP startup does not
run from the project or profile directory. Keep authentication in your local
credential setup or environment; SkillOpt does not copy credentials or create
the profile. Never commit profile contents or authentication material.

Persist the selection in `~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json`:

```json
{
  "backend": "copilot",
  "copilot_replay_profile": "replay-profile",
  "copilot_replay_tools": ["catalog-get_item", "catalog-list_items"],
  "auto_adopt": false
}
```

Both settings default to off (`""` and `[]`). Paths expand `~`; relative paths
resolve against the invoked project, not the config file. Per-run CLI options
override the corresponding persisted field; a provided tool list **replaces**,
rather than extends, the saved list:

```bash
python -m skillopt_sleep dry-run --backend copilot \
  --copilot-replay-profile replay-profile \
  --copilot-replay-tool catalog-get_item \
  --copilot-replay-tool catalog-list_items
```

The Copilot MCP shim exposes the same `copilot_replay_profile` string and
`copilot_replay_tools` array on `sleep_run` and `sleep_dry_run`. Other MCP tools
and CLI actions reject these per-run options rather than silently dropping them.
Scheduled runs can use persisted settings; the scheduler does not add these
flags to its command line.

**Execution contract.** The profile must exist and contain readable, well-formed
UTF-8 JSON with a non-empty `mcpServers` object, valid server definitions, and a
non-empty array of unique exact tool names. Names are case-sensitive, using
letters, digits, underscores, dots, and hyphens (no leading hyphen). Wildcards,
permission selectors, whitespace, and comma-separated entries are rejected.
Use the qualified names exposed by your Copilot CLI, not server-wide permission
selectors. Validation is local: it does not connect to servers to verify tool
availability, authentication, or read-only behavior.

Only replay attempts receive the selected profile and tools. Copilot mining,
judging, and reflection calls use fresh empty homes with an explicitly empty
`--available-tools` set: **no shell tools, replay MCPs, or inherited legacy tool
overrides**. This applies to both single-backend and optimizer/target-split
configurations; the target must be Copilot. Other optimizer backends keep their
own existing execution controls. Model selection is unchanged. Replay keeps the temporary cwd,
`--disable-builtin-mcps`, and `--no-custom-instructions`, and never adds shell or
filesystem tools implicitly. Rule-judge `tool_called` checks must name an
allowlisted tool; profile mode counts actual JSONL `tool.execution_start`
events rather than fabricated shell shims or the model's self-reports.

`SKILLOPT_SLEEP_COPILOT_FULL_ENV` must be unset or `0` in profile mode. The
explicit settings replace inherited `SKILLOPT_SLEEP_COPILOT_HOME` and
`COPILOT_AVAILABLE_TOOLS`; these legacy overrides and `COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL` are
removed from profile-mode child environments. Invalid or unreadable profiles,
full-environment conflicts, failed processes, and empty answers fail the cycle,
without a personal-home fallback. Profiles are checked again before each spawn.
When no profile is selected, the existing environment-based behavior is unchanged.

**Safety limits.** Copilot still uses `--allow-all-tools` to auto-approve the
tools selected by `--available-tools`. This allowlist is **not an OS sandbox**
and does not make arbitrary tools read-only. Choose genuinely read-only tools
and trusted MCP servers for read-only evaluation; a selected tool can have
external side effects, including during `dry-run` and repeated replay. All
servers in the chosen profile may start, even when some of their tools are not
selected, so keep the profile minimal and omit SkillOpt itself to avoid recursive
startup. Profiles and servers can use the caller's credentials and permissions.
Staging/adoption controls do not prevent tool-side effects; auto-adoption remains
off unless separately enabled.

Copilot can spill large MCP results to local temporary files. An MCP-only
allowlist cannot read those files unless it explicitly includes suitable local
read tooling. Prefer bounded MCP responses or explicitly select the necessary
read tool; SkillOpt does not broaden the allowlist to handle overflow.

### Pi source and backend

`--source pi` reads local session JSONL files below
`~/.pi/agent/sessions`; use `--pi-home PATH` to select the parent directory that
contains `agent/sessions`. This local source does not require the Pi CLI or
provider authentication. It retains user/assistant text, tool names, and lexical
feedback found in user text, while excluding thinking, tool arguments, tool
outputs, images, and unrelated metadata. The absolute project `cwd` from the
session header is retained for scope filtering and may appear in miner prompts
sent to a real backend and its provider. Known secret-shaped strings in retained
message text are redacted as defense in depth, not as a guarantee. Pi is an explicit source: `--source auto`
retains Codex-then-Claude precedence and does not select it.

Transcript source and model backend are independent. `--backend pi` launches a
locally installed, authenticated Pi CLI and makes real provider calls for
mining, replay, judging, and reflection. Use `--pi-path PATH` to select its
executable and `--model NAME` to override its configured model:

```bash
skillopt-sleep run --project "$(pwd)" \
  --source pi --backend pi --pi-path /absolute/path/to/pi \
  --model provider/model --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --progress
```

For these calls, SkillOpt disables Pi tools, skills, context files, extensions,
prompt templates, themes, and session writes. Pi authentication and model
configuration remain available. It also enables Pi's offline startup mode, so
configured npm/git packages are not installed or updated and model catalogs are
not refreshed; the selected model provider is still contacted for generation.
These controls should not be treated as permanent or complete isolation. The
provider selected in Pi receives the transcript-derived prompts.

The managed `schedule` command preserves the backend but not `--source`,
`--pi-home`, `--pi-path`, or `--model`. Before scheduling Pi, put
`transcript_source`, `pi_home`, `pi_path`, and `model` in
`~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json`; use an absolute `pi_path` and verify
authentication for the scheduled account.

### OpenCode source and backend

`--source opencode` reads OpenCode's local SQLite history directly in read-only
mode. The source does not launch OpenCode, require the OpenCode CLI, use its
login, or contact a model provider. Source selection remains explicit:
`--source auto` keeps Codex-then-Claude precedence and does not select OpenCode.

The database path is selected from `--opencode-db` or the `opencode_db` config
key, then `OPENCODE_DB`, then `%LOCALAPPDATA%\opencode\opencode.db` or `%APPDATA%\opencode\opencode.db` on Windows or
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/opencode/opencode.db` on POSIX. A relative
`OPENCODE_DB` value is resolved below OpenCode's data directory;
`OPENCODE_DB=:memory:` has no persistent history to harvest.

The harvester keeps visible user and assistant text, short tool names, the
recorded project directory, Git branch, and session timestamps. It excludes
reasoning, tool arguments and results, file contents, patches, and
provider/model/account metadata. Only root sessions are considered, and
sessions produced by SkillOpt's own OpenCode backend are excluded. Known
secret-shaped strings in retained text are redacted as defense in depth;
inspect harvested tasks before sending them to a real backend. The database is
opened read-only, although SQLite may still update its transient `-shm` file
while coordinating an active WAL database.

The transcript source and model backend are independent. For example, export
OpenCode-derived tasks for review before using any configured backend:

```bash
skillopt-sleep harvest --project "$(pwd)" \
  --source opencode --output reviewed-tasks.json --progress
```

`--backend opencode` runs SkillOpt's model calls for mining, plain task replay,
judging, and reflection through an installed OpenCode CLI. It uses the user's
existing OpenCode login, provider environment variables, and file-based global
configuration; SkillOpt does not manage OpenCode accounts or provider
credentials.

Install and configure OpenCode using its
[official documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/), then confirm the CLI is
available with `opencode --version`.

SkillOpt's OpenCode backend, including tool-aware replay, has been tested with
OpenCode CLI `1.18.15`. Other versions may work but have not been validated.

If OpenCode is on `PATH`, no path option is needed. Otherwise use
`--opencode-path`, the `opencode_path` config key, or
`SKILLOPT_SLEEP_OPENCODE_PATH`. Use `--model`, the `model` config key, or
`SKILLOPT_SLEEP_OPENCODE_MODEL` to override OpenCode's configured model:

```bash
skillopt-sleep run --project "$(pwd)" \
  --source opencode --backend opencode \
  --opencode-path /absolute/path/to/opencode \
  --model provider/model --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --progress
```

Plain calls run from a temporary directory with project configuration and
model-initiated tool invocation disabled. Before contacting the model, SkillOpt
discovers the resolved MCP configuration, disables every configured MCP server
for the call, and verifies that none remains enabled. If that check fails, the
model call is not made.

OpenCode tool-aware replay is disabled by default. Enable it explicitly with
`--opencode-tool-replay` or `"opencode_tool_replay": true` in
`~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json`. It applies only to tasks whose rule judge
contains a non-empty `tool_called` check. In a fresh temporary workspace,
SkillOpt creates synthetic tools with randomized names and fixed results, then
verifies which tools OpenCode actually invoked. Historical tool arguments and
results are neither retained nor replayed. Configured MCP servers remain
disabled, and the invocation allowlist includes only these temporary tools.

Both modes continue to use OpenCode's normal data directory and file-based
global configuration. OpenCode may discover or initialize custom JS/TS tools
from its global configuration directories, although SkillOpt does not allow the
model to invoke them. SkillOpt replaces `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` in the child
process to define the temporary agent and disable configured MCP servers, so
settings present only in the user's original value are unavailable. Because
`--pure` skips external plugins,
authentication or provider setup that depends on one of those plugins is also
unavailable. Calls may appear in the user's OpenCode session history. During
tool-aware replay, the fixed input (`synthetic`), fixed result, and temporary
project metadata may remain there as well. These controls are invocation
settings, not complete account or process isolation.

The managed scheduler stores the backend but not `--source`, `--opencode-db`,
`--opencode-path`, `--opencode-tool-replay`, or `--model`. Put
`transcript_source`, `opencode_db`, `opencode_path`, and `model` in
`~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json` as needed. Add
`"opencode_tool_replay": true` only when the scheduled run should enable
tool-aware replay. Use absolute database and executable paths, and verify
OpenCode access when the scheduled run uses the backend.

### Cursor source and backend

`--source cursor` reads local Cursor JSONL transcripts from
`~/.cursor/projects/<workspace>/agent-transcripts/*/*.jsonl`. Invoked scope uses
Cursor's recorded workspace path, including when `--project` is a nested
directory, and falls back to the sanitized storage name when metadata is not
available. `--scope all` scans every workspace below `cursor_home`. The
harvester retains user/assistant text, explicit turn errors, and tool names,
while excluding tool arguments, tool outputs, and non-message records. It
redacts known secret patterns and filters SkillOpt-generated replay sessions,
but redaction is not a guarantee that outbound prompts contain no sensitive
data.

`--backend cursor` launches an installed, authenticated `cursor-agent`, sends
prompts over stdin, and parses its JSON result. SkillOpt reads the target skill
and includes its text in replay prompts; it does not invoke that file as a native
Cursor skill. Ordinary mining, replay, judging, and reflection calls use
read-only Ask mode in a new empty temporary workspace. Project file reads, file
writes, and MCP tools are denied. `--project` does not change that execution
workspace.

Cursor tool-aware replay is temporarily disabled pending live Cursor
permission-boundary validation. A task with a `tool_called` check fails nonzero
before Agent mode starts and does not stage, adopt, cache, persist state, or
advance the harvest checkpoint. Use another backend for such tasks. The current
Cursor backend therefore does not provide end-to-end validation for skills that
need repository inspection, real CLIs, browsers, running services, or file
changes.

There is no implemented fresh-worktree Cursor replay. If a report says
`replay: mock`, that is the prompt-replay label and does not mean the mock model
backend was selected. Both `run` and `dry-run` perform real-backend provider
calls; `dry-run` suppresses staging, adoption, and persisted state changes, not
spend. Session and task limits do not impose hard provider-call, token, time, or
monetary budgets.
Cursor and its selected model provider can receive the prompt content.

Cursor-specific settings are available through the CLI, config, and environment:

| Purpose | CLI | `~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json` | Environment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transcript home | `--cursor-home PATH` | `"cursor_home": "/path/to/.cursor"` | none |
| Agent executable | `--cursor-path PATH` | `"cursor_path": "/path/to/cursor-agent"` | `SKILLOPT_SLEEP_CURSOR_PATH` |
| Model | `--model NAME` | `"model": "NAME"` | `SKILLOPT_SLEEP_CURSOR_MODEL` |

Use `cursor-agent --list-models` to inspect model identifiers available to the
authenticated account. When cost depends on a model variant, confirm the billed
variant in Cursor's usage reporting rather than relying only on its display
name.

Target the learned project skill explicitly so accepted updates are visible to
Cursor without modifying the plugin's own `skillopt-sleep` workflow skill:

```bash
skillopt-sleep run --project "$(pwd)" \
  --source cursor --backend cursor \
  --target-skill-path .cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md \
  --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --progress
```

The first harvest uses a 72-hour lookback unless `--lookback-hours` is set. A
value of `0` considers all available history while still respecting
`--max-sessions`. A stateful `run`, including a run that mines no tasks, records
a new harvest checkpoint; subsequent runs use that checkpoint rather than the
initial lookback. Use `harvest` or `dry-run` to verify counts before the first
stateful run.

The managed `schedule` command persists the project, backend, time, and optional
auto-adopt setting only. It does not copy source, Cursor paths, model, or target
skill flags into the scheduled command. Put `transcript_source`, `cursor_home`,
`cursor_path`, `model`, and `target_skill_path` in the user config before
scheduling Cursor. Keep `target_skill_path` project-relative as
`.cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md`, prefer an absolute
`cursor_path`, and verify authentication for the scheduled account because cron
and Task Scheduler may have a minimal environment.

Backend-specific setup for compatible endpoints is documented in
[OpenAI-compatible endpoints for SkillOpt-Sleep](../sleep/openai-compatible-endpoints.md).
