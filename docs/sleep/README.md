# SkillOpt-Sleep 😴 — deployment-time companion (preview)

**SkillOpt-Sleep** applies SkillOpt's discipline to your *own daily usage*. It gives a
local coding agent a nightly **sleep cycle** that reviews your past sessions, replays
your recurring tasks on your own API budget, and consolidates what it learns into
**validated** long-term memory and skills — behind a held-out gate, staged for your
review. It requires **no weight training** and adds no separate optimization loop to
normal agent requests.

> **Preview.** This is an early preview we are actively iterating on; interfaces and
> defaults may change. The engine lives in the top-level [`skillopt_sleep/`](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/tree/main/skillopt_sleep)
> package with **zero dependency** on the paper's `skillopt/` code (the validation gate
> is vendored).

## How it works

One "night":

```
harvest Claude Code / Codex / VS Code Copilot / Cursor / Pi / OpenCode transcripts → mine recurring tasks → replay via the configured backend (isolation varies by backend; mock/handoff make no network calls)
   → consolidate (reflect → bounded edit → GATE on real held-out tasks)
   → stage proposal → (you) adopt
```

It synthesizes **SkillOpt** (validation-gated bounded text edits), **Claude Dreams**
(offline consolidation; review-then-adopt), and the **agent-sleep** idea (short-term
experience → long-term competence).

The optional `gate_no_regression` config key strengthens the aggregate gate.
It defaults to `false` for compatibility; when set to `true`, every validation
task must preserve or improve its score under the configured `gate_metric`.
The check applies to intermediate skill and memory candidates and to the fresh
final replay. A missing task result or non-finite task score also blocks the
candidate; an absent numeric score aborts evaluation. Task-level changes are
included in `report.md`, `report.json`, `diagnostics.json`, the CLI's `--json`
output, and the evidence log.

Rule-based heading checks are intentionally additive. `section_present` keeps
its legacy strict behavior for existing task sets: an ATX heading cannot append
text after the requested name. Use `section_contains` when a numbered,
bilingual, or annotated ATX Markdown heading should pass; it matches the
requested text literally and case-insensitively within the ATX heading only,
not in bold lines, labels, or ordinary body text. Both operators are shape-only
checks and should be paired with an outcome check or substantive rubric.

### Optimizer feedback boundary

Judge evidence and optimizer feedback have different trust and retention needs.
`ReplayResult.fail_reason` and `judge_rationale` retain the raw scoring evidence
for replay results and audit surfaces such as diagnostics and `evidence.jsonl`.
Reflection, contrastive reflection, and slow update instead consume
`optimizer_feedback`, which is a semantic projection intended to describe the
user-visible behavior to improve.

For a rule judge, the separation looks like this:

| Stage | Example |
|---|---|
| Mined check | `{"op":"regex","arg":"(?im)^\\s*ROUTE:...$","description":"Route recurring consultation requests through the consultation utility."}` |
| Raw audit evidence | `failed: regex=(?im)^\s*ROUTE:...$` |
| Before this boundary | The raw failure could be copied into reflection, encouraging a rule that imitates the regex. |
| Optimizer feedback now | `Route recurring consultation requests through the consultation utility.` |
| Reviewable proposal | A general routing instruction, without the regex or check expression. |

The deterministic integration regression in
`tests/test_optimizer_feedback_flow.py` carries that description through mining,
replay, reflection, the validation gate, and staging: its synthetic rule score
moves from 0.0 to 1.0 while the proposal remains free of the regex. That proves
useful signal survives this specific rule-judge path; it is not evidence that
optimization quality is preserved for every judge type or real workload.

Descriptions are a targeted projection, not a universal sanitizer. They are
expected to be trusted, operator- or miner-provided semantic statements. A regex
description that literally copies its pattern is rejected, but arbitrary prose
may still contain unsafe, sensitive, misleading, or prompt-like content. Do not
treat this channel as an adversarial-input boundary, and continue to review mined
tasks and staged proposals before adoption. Raw evidence files remain sensitive
local artifacts even though they are excluded from optimizer prompts.

Non-rule judges have no structured check from which the engine can reliably
derive a safe semantic explanation. A failed exact, rubric, or legacy
deserialized result therefore receives the generic optimizer message:

```text
The response did not satisfy the task's evaluation criteria.
```

This fail-closed fallback prevents an exact/rubric judge rationale such as
`private-evaluator-expression: expected internal label X` from becoming learning
context, but it also removes potentially useful information about how the answer
was deficient. The change contains verifier leakage; it does **not** establish
that optimization quality is preserved for non-rule tasks. Restoring richer
feedback requires a future typed, explicitly learning-safe feedback API rather
than reusing raw judge rationale.

## How to use it

### Quickest path: the `skillopt-sleep` CLI (pip)

```bash
pip install skillopt        # installs the engine + the `skillopt-sleep` command
skillopt-sleep dry-run      # harvest + mine + replay, report only; stages nothing
skillopt-sleep run          # a full nightly cycle; the proposal is staged for review
skillopt-sleep status       # show state + the latest staged proposal
skillopt-sleep adopt --legacy       # apply a reviewed managed proposal
skillopt-sleep adopt --skill NAME   # adopt one staged skill (repeatable)
skillopt-sleep adopt --all-skills   # adopt every still-pending fan-out skill
skillopt-sleep schedule     # install a nightly cron entry for this project
```

The per-agent integrations below still come from the repo; the CLI above is the
standalone, pip-only way to run a cycle. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, and
Devin wrap the shared engine. OpenClaw is a separate reference adaptation and has
its own setup.

One engine, thin per-agent shells (see [`plugins/`](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/tree/main/plugins)):

| Platform | Folder | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | [`plugins/claude-code`](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/tree/main/plugins/claude-code) | `/plugin marketplace add ./plugins/claude-code` → `/skillopt-sleep` |
| **Codex** | [`plugins/codex`](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/tree/main/plugins/codex) | `bash plugins/codex/install.sh` → `skillopt-sleep` skill |
| **Cursor** | [`plugins/cursor`](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/tree/main/plugins/cursor) | `bash plugins/cursor/install.sh` → `/skillopt-sleep` |
| **Copilot** | [`plugins/copilot`](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/tree/main/plugins/copilot) | register `plugins/copilot/mcp_server.py` as an MCP server |
| **Devin** | [`plugins/devin`](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/tree/main/plugins/devin) | register `plugins/devin/mcp_server.py` as an MCP server |
| **OpenClaw** | [`plugins/openclaw`](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/tree/main/plugins/openclaw) | adapt the reference wrapper and paths for your installation |

### VS Code GitHub Copilot Chat

Use `--source copilot` to harvest local VS Code GitHub Copilot Chat sessions.
SkillOpt auto-detects stable and Insiders VS Code `User/workspaceStorage`
roots, plus the portable root when `VSCODE_PORTABLE` is available. Override
discovery with `--vscode-workspace-storage PATH`. Project scoping comes from
each storage entry's adjacent `workspace.json`, and entries without a safe
local mapping are skipped. `--source auto` retains Codex-then-Claude precedence
and does not select Copilot.

```bash
skillopt-sleep harvest --project "$(pwd)" --source copilot --progress
skillopt-sleep dry-run --project "$(pwd)" --source copilot --backend copilot
```

The source and backend are independent: `--source copilot` reads VS Code's
local history, while `--backend copilot` uses the separately installed and
authenticated GitHub Copilot CLI for mining, replay, judging, and reflection.
Inspect harvested tasks before using a real backend on sensitive projects.

Replay does not inherit the caller's MCP definitions. To opt into a dedicated
local profile and exact replay tool allowlist, use `copilot_replay_profile` and
`copilot_replay_tools`; see the [configuration and safety contract](../reference/cli.md#copilot-replay-mcp-profile).
Selected tools are auto-approved, not automatically read-only, even in `dry-run`.

The managed scheduler does not preserve `--source` or
`--vscode-workspace-storage`. Before scheduling this source, put
`"transcript_source": "copilot"` and, for a nonstandard root,
`"vscode_workspace_storage": "/absolute/path/to/workspaceStorage"` in
`~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json`.

### Pi

Pi transcript harvesting and model execution are independent. Use `--source pi`
to read local session JSONL files below `~/.pi/agent/sessions`, or set
`--pi-home` to the parent directory that contains `agent/sessions` (the default
is `~/.pi`). The source alone does not require Pi CLI installation or provider
authentication. Pi is never selected implicitly:
`--source auto` retains Codex-then-Claude precedence.

`--backend pi` uses a locally installed and authenticated Pi CLI for real
model-provider calls during mining, replay, judging, and reflection. Select its
executable with `--pi-path` and override its configured model with `--model`:

```bash
skillopt-sleep run --project "$(pwd)" \
  --source pi --backend pi --pi-path /absolute/path/to/pi \
  --model provider/model --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --progress
```

These calls disable tools, skills, context files, extensions, prompt templates,
themes, and session writes, but still use the user's Pi authentication and model
configuration. They also enable Pi's offline startup mode to prevent configured
npm/git package installation, package updates, and model-catalog refresh; the
selected model provider is still contacted. Treat those controls as bounded
invocation setup, not permanent or complete isolation. A real Pi backend sends
transcript-derived prompts to the provider configured in Pi; inspect that
provider's retention and privacy policy first. The `mock` and `handoff` backends
make no network calls.

The managed scheduler records the backend but does not preserve `--source`,
`--pi-home`, `--pi-path`, or `--model`. Before scheduling Pi, set
`transcript_source`, `pi_home`, `pi_path`, and `model` in
`~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json`. Use an absolute `pi_path` and verify the
scheduled account's Pi authentication.

### OpenCode

Use `--source opencode` to read local OpenCode SQLite history without launching
the CLI or requiring login or provider access. It is not selected by
`--source auto`. See the
[CLI reference](../reference/cli.md#opencode-source-and-backend) for database
selection and the retained-data boundary.

For model calls, install and configure OpenCode using its
[official documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/), then confirm the CLI is
available with `opencode --version`.

`--backend opencode` sends SkillOpt's model calls for mining, plain task replay,
judging, and reflection through an installed OpenCode CLI, using the user's
existing login, provider environment variables, and file-based global
configuration. Select a binary and model only when the OpenCode defaults are
not suitable:

```bash
skillopt-sleep run --project "$(pwd)" \
  --source opencode --backend opencode \
  --opencode-path /absolute/path/to/opencode --model provider/model
```

Plain calls disable project configuration, model-initiated tool invocation,
external plugins, and configured MCP servers. SkillOpt stops before the model
call if it cannot confirm that every resolved MCP server is disabled.

Tool-aware replay is disabled by default. Enable it with
`--opencode-tool-replay` or `"opencode_tool_replay": true` for tasks whose rule
judge contains a `tool_called` check. It exposes temporary synthetic tools with
randomized names and fixed results, verifies which tools OpenCode actually
invokes, and denies all other tools. Historical tool arguments and results are
not retained or replayed.

Both modes continue to use OpenCode's normal data directory and file-based
global configuration. Calls may therefore appear in session history, and global
custom JS/TS tools may initialize, although SkillOpt does not allow the model to
invoke them. See the
[CLI reference](../reference/cli.md#opencode-source-and-backend) for complete
configuration, history, and isolation details.

For scheduled runs, configure the source, database, executable, and model in
`~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json` as needed. Set `opencode_tool_replay` to `true`
there to opt in to tool-aware replay.

### Cursor

Cursor transcript harvesting and model execution are independent. Use
`--source cursor` to read
`~/.cursor/projects/<workspace>/agent-transcripts/*/*.jsonl`; `--scope invoked`
uses Cursor's recorded workspace path, with the sanitized storage directory as
a fallback, while `--scope all` scans every Cursor workspace. Use
`--cursor-home` for a different Cursor home. `--source auto` keeps its existing
Codex-then-Claude precedence and does not select Cursor.

`--backend cursor` requires an installed, authenticated `cursor-agent`. If it is
not on `PATH`, select it with `--cursor-path`, `SKILLOPT_SLEEP_CURSOR_PATH`, or
the `cursor_path` config key. Select a model with `--model` or
`SKILLOPT_SLEEP_CURSOR_MODEL`. Point adoption at a project Cursor skill rather
than at the plugin's workflow skill:

```bash
skillopt-sleep run --project "$(pwd)" \
  --source cursor --backend cursor \
  --target-skill-path .cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md \
  --max-sessions 5 --max-tasks 3 --progress
```

The target skill is supplied to Cursor as prompt text; it is not invoked as a
native skill. `--project` selects transcript scope, target files, state, and
staging, but ordinary Cursor calls cannot inspect that project's files. The
current backend therefore evaluates textual guidance rather than end-to-end
repository, CLI, browser, or service workflows.

Cursor tool-aware replay is temporarily disabled pending live Cursor
permission-boundary validation. If a task contains a `tool_called` check, the
Cursor backend exits nonzero before starting Agent mode and does not stage,
adopt, or advance state. Use another backend for those tasks.

The initial harvest window is 72 hours. Set `--lookback-hours N` explicitly when
older sessions should be considered; `0` scans all history subject to the
session limit. A stateful `run`, even with no mined tasks, advances the harvest
checkpoint. Use `harvest` or `dry-run` to inspect counts first. A real-backend
`dry-run` still incurs provider calls and spend, and session/task limits are not
hard call, token, time, or monetary budgets.

The managed scheduler records only the project, backend, time, and optional
auto-adopt setting. It does not preserve Cursor source, home, CLI path, model, or
target-skill flags. Before `skillopt-sleep schedule --backend cursor`, put
`transcript_source`, `cursor_home`, `cursor_path`, `model`, and
`target_skill_path` in `~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json`. The target may remain
project-relative as `.cursor/skills/skillopt-sleep-learned/SKILL.md`. Use an
absolute `cursor_path` and verify that the scheduled account is already
authenticated, because cron and Task Scheduler may run with a minimal
environment.

**[OpenAI-compatible endpoints](openai-compatible-endpoints.md)**. That guide also
documents the separate HTTPS-only boundary for Azure managed-identity credentials.

Deterministic proof (no API key):
`python -m skillopt_sleep.experiments.run_experiment --persona researcher --assert-improves`.

### Opt-in: per-skill fan-out

Set `"multi_skill_fanout": true` in `~/.skillopt-sleep/config.json` to add an
independent gate result and reviewable proposal for every explicit skill hint
mined that night. `multi_skill_report` remains a compatibility alias:

```json
{"multi_skill_fanout": true}
```

This runs one additional consolidation per group (including a catch-all group when
hinted and unhinted evidence are mixed), so it multiplies backend calls and token
use; configured dream rollouts and synthetic variants multiply the per-group work
too. Each group inherits the configured edit budget, gate mode/metric,
`gate_no_regression`, `dream_rollouts`, `dream_factor`, `recall_k`, and
`evolve_skill`. Recalled archive tasks are restricted to that same skill hint;
shared memory is read-only in fan-out runs. Setting `evolve_skill` to `false`
therefore disables per-skill proposals as well as the managed skill proposal.

Each explicitly hinted group resolves and reads its own live `SKILL.md` before
consolidation, so its staged proposal preserves that skill's baseline. Missing,
ambiguous, unreadable, aliased, or colliding skills are skipped and reported
instead of falling back to the managed document. Adoption remains review-driven:
choose fan-out proposals with `adopt --skill NAME` or `--all-skills`, and use
`adopt --legacy` for a co-staged managed skill/memory pair. `auto_adopt` never
promotes the per-skill fan-out. Nights containing only the managed catch-all group
keep the existing single-consolidation behavior.

Resolution searches existing project-native `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`,
`.cursor/skills`, and `.devin/skills` directories, then the established Claude
home and plugin-cache roots. Add repeatable `--skill-root PATH` values when an
integration stores skills elsewhere. Relative roots resolve below `--project`.

### Opt-in: experience replay & dream rollouts

Two consolidation mechanisms, both default **off** (behavior is unchanged unless you
enable them). They strengthen the nightly update when your tasks have a clean
correctness signal; the validation gate still governs what ships.

| Config knob | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `dream_rollouts` | `1` | Run each task K times → learn from the good-vs-bad contrast (contrastive reflection). |
| `recall_k` | `0` | Associative recall — pull the K most-similar past tasks (from a persisted archive) into tonight's dream. |
| `dream_factor` | `0` | Add N lightweight synthetic variants of each task. |

### Paired A/B evalkit

Reports and PRs that claim "B beats A" should go through the shared evalkit
rather than quoting a single-run cell. One command pairs two conditions on one
fixed task manifest, runs McNemar's test, and reports a bootstrap CI on the
success-rate delta. The nightly gate is unchanged.

```text
python -m skillopt_sleep.evalkit --manifest tasks.json --a cond_a.json --b cond_b.json
```

See [`evalkit.md`](evalkit.md) for the id-set contract, task-cluster inference
over positional seed repeats, A/A checks, and the point-estimate-only published
RESULTS cell replay.

## Results

> 📊 **More results & analysis — the gate-safety stress test, experience-replay
> scaling, and the dream-diversity ablation — are in
> [`docs/sleep/RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md).** The highlights:

**Controlled experiment recipe (not the shipping CLI defaults).** 5 nights × 10 new
real "today" tasks per night; the full held-out **test** split is scored before night
1 (baseline) and after night 5 (after); optimizer = GPT-5.5; single seed (42). The
experiments use the shipped consolidation and gate components, while the nightly CLI
and benchmark harnesses remain separate entry points. Numbers are absolute held-out
accuracy; **Δ** = `after − baseline` in percentage points.

**(a) End-to-end on real agents — [gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals) `skillopt-v1`.**
Deficient seed skills go **0.00 → 1.00** on the held-out set with **both Claude Code
and Codex** as the target agent (all 4 seeds, including a real tool-use loop).

**(b) Experience replay scales the gain — SearchQA** (1,400-item held-out test,
SQuAD exact-match; target = GPT-5.5; **validation-gated**):

| Replay config (`dream_rollouts=5`) | Baseline → After | Δ (pts) |
|---|---|---|
| `recall_k=10` | 0.802 → 0.834 | +3.1 |
| `recall_k=20` | 0.803 → 0.848 | **+4.5** |
| full-history replay *(reference, not a shipping default)* | 0.796 → 0.851 | +5.6 |
| `recall_k=10`, `dream_rollouts=8` *(more dreaming, same recall)* | 0.798 → 0.835 | +3.7 |

The gain rises monotonically with how much relevant past experience is recalled. The
same SearchQA cell **without** the gate (`recall_k=10`) is 0.808 → 0.839 (+3.1).

**(c) Second benchmark — SpreadsheetBench** (280-item held-out test; the agent's
generated openpyxl code is executed and compared cell-by-cell to a golden workbook;
target = GPT-5.4-nano; gate-free + the output-contract guardrail): 0.279 → 0.314 (**+3.6**).

**(d) Honest scope.** These gains hold where tasks recur and have a checkable
correctness signal. On saturated or noisy benchmarks (e.g. a strong model already
near ceiling) the effect is **flat within run-to-run noise** — single-seed baseline
variance here is ±1–2 pts, so treat sub-~1.5 pt differences as noise. The validation
gate keeps the worst case bounded; keep it **on** by default.

The **low-level** API for staging one proposal per skill and adopting a reviewed
subset (`staged_skills` / `adopt_skills`, plus `status` and `adopt --skill`) is
documented in [`docs/sleep/multi-skill-staging.md`](multi-skill-staging.md).
That page also documents the opt-in nightly fan-out, where every hinted group
derives its proposal from its own resolved live `SKILL.md` while adoption remains
an explicit human decision.
